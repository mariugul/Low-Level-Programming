# Low-Level Programming
This is the term project for TDT4258 - Low-Level Programming at NTNU Trondheim, fall 2019. The practical goal of the lab exercises was to implement a small game for the EFM32 development board. This development board has a microcontroller, a display and sound. In addition, there's given a small prototype gamepad with buttons and LEDs. Together, this system provides all the hardware components which are needed for making a computer game. The task was to program the microcontroller to control all I/Oâ€“components needed for the game and use these in a computer game we implemented ourselves.
